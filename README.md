# DarkShare

A program to securely share a file of any size with someone, designed to be run in Tails. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor hidden service, and making it require a password to access and download the file. It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party filesharing service. It all just runs inside Tails and uses the Tor network.
